# Release notes


## 0.9.4

This version adds new extensions, e.g. for taking a screenshot of any `SwiftUI` view.


## 0.9.3

This version adds a `DocumentCamera` view, which can be used to scan documents with the device camera.


## 0.9.2

This version adds a `dismiss` function to `PresentationContext`.

This means that these contexts get access to this function:

* `AlertContext`
* `SheetContext`
* `ToastContext`


## 0.9.1

This version adds improved support for watchOS, tvOS and macOS.

The bump version process has been improved to also add linting and a unit test confirmation.


## 0.9.0

There are now more convenient `alert`, `sheet` and `toast` view modifiers, that take a context instead of a binding and a content.

This version contains more breaking changes for the toast components.

* `ToastContext` works just like `SheetContext` and `AlertContext`.
* `ToastContext`, `SheetContext` and `AlertContext` share a base class.
* There is a new `ToastProvider` that can be used with `ToastContext`.
* The `toast` modifier handles presenting and dismissing the toast.
* The `Toast` view has been removed, since it's no longer needed.

You can now use any views with the toast context and modifier, so it should make the toast easier to understand and to use.


## 0.8.2

This release renames the alert and sheet `Presentable` protocols to `Provider`. The old presentables are still around, but marked as deprecated.


## 0.8.1

This release fixes invalid iOS platform version build problems and adds a `Color+Random` extension.


## 0.8.0

This release:

* adds support for macOS, and disables a bunch of features that require UIKit.
* adjusts the `Toast` so that it fits better with the alert and sheet contexts.
* adds a new `UIViewWrapper` that simplifies wrapping `UIKit` views.


## 0.7.0

This release adds:

* A `DismissableView` view protocol that simplifies dismissing views programatically.
* A `KeyboardAvoiding` modifier and view extension.
* A `MultilineTextView`  that wraps a `UITextView`.


## 0.6.0

This release adds:

* An `AlertContext` that simplifies working with alerts.
* A `SheetContext`  that simplifies working with modal sheets.
* A `QrCodeGenerator` and a `StandardQrCodeGenerator` implementation.


## 0.5.0

This release adds:

* An `ImagePicker`  that can be used to present a `UIImagePickerController`.
* An `FilePicker` that can be used to present a `UIDocumentPickerViewController`.
* An `ShareSheet` that can be used to present a `UIActivityViewController`.
* An `UserDefaultsPersisted` property wrapper that lets you persist data to `UserDefaults`.


## 0.4.2

This release changes the `View` geometry extensions and replaces `bindGeometry(to: ...)` with:

* `bindSafeAreaInsets(to: ...)`
* `bindSize(to: ...)`

You can use them like this:

```swift
@State private var size: CGSize = .zero
@State private var size: CGSize = .zero
UIColor.red.bindGeometry(to: $height)Â { $0.size.height }
```

## 0.4.1

This release makes the podspec is updated to require Swift 5.2.


## 0.4.0

This release adds a new geometry `View` extension:

* `bindGeometry(to: ...)` lets you bind any `CGFloat` geometry value for a view.

The extension injects a `GeometryReader` and provides values to the provided binding.


## 0.3.0

This release adds some new toast features:

* `ToastContext` is an observable object can be used to manage a view's toast.
* `ToastStyle` is a new struct that contains all available styles for a toast.

This release makes some small api changes:

* The `SwipeGesture` initializer has been made public.
* `Toast` now uses `ToastStyle`  instead of separate style properties.
* The `Toast` extensions now require you to specify a background.
* The text-based `Toast` extension automatically centers the text.    


## 0.2.1

This release adds a new `FontIdentifier`. 

It can be implemented by any font provider, e.g. `SwiftGen`s `FontConvertible`. 


## 0.2.0

This release adds new style structs:

* `CornerRadiusStyle` style can be used to specify corner radii.
* `FontStyle` style can be used to specify custom fonts.
* `ShadowStyle` style can be used to specify drop shadow styles.

These view modifiers simplifies using these styles:

* `cornerRadius(_ style:)` can be used to apply a `CornerRadiusStyle`.
* `font(_ style: FontStyle)` can be used to apply a `FontStyle`.
* `font(name:, style:, weight:)` can also be used to apply custom fonts.
* `shadow(_ style:)` can be used to apply a `ShadowStyle`.

The release also adds new view extensions:

* `blur(...)` simplifies using the system blur styles that are specified in this library.
* `border(content:,width:,cornerRadius:)` can be used to apply borders with a certain content (e.g. Color.red), width and corner radius.


## 0.1.0

This is the very first release of SwiftUIKit. It contains a bunch of features, which are described in the readme.
